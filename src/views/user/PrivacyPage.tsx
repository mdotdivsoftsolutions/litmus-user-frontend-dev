          </li>
          <li>

        <h2>2. How we use information</h2>
        <p>
          We use personal data to schedule collections, route orders to labs, deliver reports, send transactional notifications,
          provide customer support, comply with law, and improve our services. With your consent, we may send marketing messages;
          you can opt out anytime from message footers or account settings when available.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          We share the minimum necessary information with partner laboratories, logistics vendors, and payment processors to fulfil your order.
          We may disclose information if required by regulation, court order, or to protect the safety of users and the public.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain order and report-related records as needed for healthcare compliance, dispute resolution, and auditing,
          then delete or anonymize according to internal schedules and applicable law.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We apply administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to protect personal data. No method of transmission
          over the Internet is perfectly secure; please use strong passwords and report suspicious activity to Support.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Your rights</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct, export, or delete certain personal data, and to object to some processing.
          Contact us to exercise these rights; we may verify your identity before responding.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Changes</h2>
